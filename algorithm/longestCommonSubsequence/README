implete longest-common-subsequence algorithm
find the longest common subsequence 

there are two functions:
longestCommonSubsequence_n returns the length of the longest common subsequence
longestCommonSubsequence returns one of the longest common subsequence

example:
string str1 = "BDCABA";
string str2 = "ABCBDAB";
longestCommonSubsequence_n -> 4
longestCommonSubSequence -> {'B','C','B','A'}
